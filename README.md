# JavaIOPi
A Java API to control your Raspberry Pi over the internet.

## Introduction
Developed for [SBC Remote](https://github.com/M2MCircuits/sbcremote), a mobile application for Android and iOS that allows the user to remotely monitor and configure the GPIO ports of Raspberry Pis, this is a Java API which you can use to control the GPIO ports of Raspberry Pis over the internet. 

## Requirements
This API depends on the [WebIOPi software](http://webiopi.trouch.com) and services provided by [Weaved](https://weaved.com/). You will need to download and install WebIOPi through which you can also install the Weaved WebIOPi service. A Weaved account is necessary for the installer and the API to work. The API also requires the [JSON-simple](https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/) and [Apache HttpComponents](https://hc.apache.org/) to function.
